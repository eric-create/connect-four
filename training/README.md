# connect-four

This program is to create a set of trainig data for training a ML model to become a connect
easonable four player. Rust seems to be an interesting choice in terms of performance and
staggering popularity.

```bash
cargo run

# Thoughts

It would be interesting to see if it causes any trouble for the ML model to learn if we do
not tell in the training data who is the winner, if all fields are claimed and there is a
winner. I'd guess it does not cause any problems.
